Paper example:

Introduction
Suppose we decide to test out a completely different introduction, we can create a branch, and if 
we decide we like it, we can merge it into the master later.
As we can see,  git was able to magically combine the two separate files we were working on (I changed the introduction, 
while you changed the theory). There are situations when merging can be an issue, but I haven't encountered it. As far as I understand
following some simple rules can avoid pain.

Theory
Some equations and theory
Now, suppose that you wish to add to the theory. I can work on the alternate introduction on a separate branch (if we are still undecided
about which introduction we would like to keep). At any point the alternate introduction that I have been working on can be 'merged' into this
file. Let's test it out.
