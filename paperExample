Paper example:

Introduction
This is the first example of an introduction

Theory
Some equations and theory
Now, suppose that you wish to add to the theory. I can work on the alternate introduction on a separate branch (if we are still undecided
about which introduction we would like to keep). At any point the alternate introduction that I have been working on can be 'merged' into this
file. Let's test it out.
